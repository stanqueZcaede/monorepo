One of his most notable works was the *Vocabulaire juridique*, a legal dictionary that he edited with the collaboration of other professors, magistrates and jurists. The first edition was published in 1930 and contained more than 6,000 entries covering various branches of law, such as civil, commercial, criminal, administrative, international and constitutional law.
  
The *Vocabulaire juridique* was not only a collection of definitions, but also a source of information and analysis on the history, evolution and principles of legal concepts and institutions. It aimed to provide a clear and precise language for legal communication and education, as well as to foster a common understanding of legal terms among different legal systems.
  
The *Vocabulario juridico* is the Spanish translation of Capitant's work, which was first published in 1961 by Depalma in Buenos Aires. The translator was Aquiles Horacio Guaglianone, a prominent Argentine lawyer and academic. The Spanish version adapted the original content to the context and needs of Latin American law, adding new entries and references to local legislation and jurisprudence.
  
The *Vocabulario juridico* is still a valuable resource for law students and professionals who want to learn more about the meaning and origin of legal terms, as well as to compare and contrast different legal systems. It is also a testament to the legacy and influence of Henri Capitant, who contributed to the advancement and enrichment of legal culture in the world.
  
The Association Henri Capitant is still active today, with more than 45 national groups and correspondents around the world. It organizes regular meetings and conferences to exchange ideas and experiences on various legal topics, such as contract law, family law, human rights, environmental law, digital law and comparative law.
  
The Association also publishes several publications, such as the *Henri Capitant Law Review*, a bilingual journal dedicated to civil law traditions, the *Travaux de l'Association Henri Capitant*, a collection of reports and studies on specific legal issues, and the *Guide mÃ©thodologique*, a handbook for legal research and writing.
  
The Association Henri Capitant is open to anyone who is interested in promoting, disseminating and modernizing civil law traditions. It welcomes members from different backgrounds and professions, such as academics, judges, lawyers, notaries and corporate lawyers. It also collaborates with other institutions and organizations that share its values and objectives.
  
The Association Henri Capitant is not only a network of legal experts, but also a community of friends who share a common passion for law and culture. It aims to foster dialogue and cooperation among different legal systems, as well as to preserve and enrich the heritage of Henri Capitant, who was a visionary and a pioneer of legal culture.
